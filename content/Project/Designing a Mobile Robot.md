## Motor Speed
- RPM is the number of revolution per minute
- One revolution is 2Â **$\pi$**
- Angular velocity is the angular change in position of an object per second, measured in radians per second.
- So the relationship between RPM and angular velocity is
$$
w = \frac{RPM}{60second/minute}*2\pi rad/rev
$$
- And Angular Velocity to Speed
$$
v=wr
$$
