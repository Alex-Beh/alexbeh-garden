$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}1 & 4 & 5 \\ 2 & 8 & 10\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 2\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}1 & 4 & 5\end{bmatrix}.
$$

A has [[Rank, Basis, Dimension#Rank|Rank]] $1$ because each of its columns is a multiple of the first column.

Every rank 1 matrix $A$ can be written $A = \boldsymbol{u}\boldsymbol{v}^\mathrm{T}$, where $\boldsymbol{u}$ and $\boldsymbol{v}$ are column vectors. We can use rank $1$ matrices as building blocks for more complex matrices.
